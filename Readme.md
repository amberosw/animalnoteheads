###Prerequisites  
* You need to install [Lilypond](http://www.lilypond.org) 
    * Ignore the instructions about command-line 
* Install [Gidole font](http://gidole.github.io)
    * It's the one I'm using on AnimalNoteHeads.com
    * Mac users: You have to copy it manually to `/Library/Fonts` and not `~/Library/Fonts` for Lilypond to be able to "find" it
