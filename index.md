### Concept

Substitute note heads with cute and colorful animals.  
"A" for alligator, "B" for bear etc.
The ambition is to make a huge collection of sheets that people can use freely.

### Guides

Print and cut the pdf and put it just above the keys on the piano. Choose the correct paper size: [A4](assets/pdf/AnimalNoteHeads-keys-en-A4.pdf) / [US Letter](assets/pdf/AnimalNoteHeads-keys-en-Letter.pdf).
