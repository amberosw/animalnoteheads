### Languages

AnimalNoteHeads currently supports English, French, Spanish and Danish. I'll be adding more as you [tell me the names](https://github.com/andreaslarsen/animalnoteheads/issues/6) in your language.

### [PDF](assets/pdf/) Piano Guides

Print, cut and put them behind the keys. Octave length on your piano divided by 165mm (6.5") equals print scale - e.g. 99mm / 165mm = 60%.

### Affilliates
I'm interested in a company/organisation/foundation that would support the project in turn for e.g. "brought to you by ..." - I'd like to devote more time to the project and possibly make it completely free for everyone to use.
