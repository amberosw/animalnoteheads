### Concept

Substitute note heads with cute and colorful animals - e.g. alligator for "A". The ambition is, with your help, to make a huge collection of sheets in multiple languages that people can use freely.

### Guides

- Choose the correct paper size: [A4](assets/pdf/AnimalNoteHeads-keys-en-A4.pdf){:target="_blank"} / [US Letter](assets/pdf/AnimalNoteHeads-keys-en-Letter.pdf){:target="_blank"}
- Print (100%) and cut it
- Put it just above the keys on the piano
