### Piano Guides

[Color](assets/pdf/AnimalNoteHeads-keys-en-A4.pdf){:target="_blank"} or with [black outlines](assets/pdf/AnimalNoteHeads-keys-en-bw-A4.pdf){:target="_blank"}. Print and put them behind the keys. Measure the octave length on your piano and divide it by 165mm (6.5") to get the print scale (99/165 = 60%).

### Translators
Will be listed here - I'm currently [looking for](https://github.com/andreaslarsen/animalnoteheads/issues/6) animal names in your language so I can draw them.

### Affilliates
I'm interested in a company/organisation that would support the project in turn for e.g. "brought to you by ..." - I'd like to devote more time to the project and possibly make it completely free for everyone to use.
