### Concept
A crowdsourced project where every note head is substituted so that A equals alligator, Re es igual ratón, C er lig med chimpanze, Fa égale fourmi, Σολ ισούται με φίδι, etc...  

### Sheets
The sheets come in animal, normal and color yourself versions. You can create your own and/or view other peoples submissions on [animalnoteheads.com/sheets](http://animalnoteheads.com/sheets).

### Piano
Use the free Pianimo iOS app (pending Apple review) or buy the 4$ stickers (see below).

### Support Me

<!--
### Affilliates
I'm interested in a company/organisation/foundation that would support the project in turn for e.g. "brought to you by ..." - I'd like to devote more time to the project and possibly make it completely free for everyone to use.-->
