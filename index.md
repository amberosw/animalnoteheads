### Concept

Substitute note heads with cute and colorful animals - e.g. alligator for "A". The ambition is, with your help, to make a huge collection of sheets in multiple languages that everyone can use freely.

### Guides

- Color [A4](assets/pdf/AnimalNoteHeads-keys-en-A4.pdf){:target="_blank"} - [US Letter](assets/pdf/AnimalNoteHeads-keys-en-Letter.pdf){:target="_blank"}
- Black outline [A4](assets/pdf/AnimalNoteHeads-keys-en-bw-A4.pdf){:target="_blank"} - [US Letter](assets/pdf/AnimalNoteHeads-keys-en-bw-Letter.pdf){:target="_blank"}
- Print (100%) and cut it
- Put it just above the keys on the piano

$upport me on [patreon](https://www.patreon.com/andreaslarsen){:target="_blank"} or buy an AnimalNoteHeads item (ideas...?) that I'll put up soon.  
Every little tweet, like, pin, forum share etc. is also great! It gives me more time to create great content for you:)

### Are you a company?

I'm interested in talking with companies that would support me financially in turn for som unobtrusive publicity e.g. "brought to you by YOUR COMPANY". I would like to devote more time on the project and make it completely free for everyone to use.
