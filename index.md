### Concept
An open source project where every note head is substituted so that A equals alligator, Re es igual ratón, C er lig med chimpanze, Fa égale fourmi, Σολ ισούται με φίδι, etc...

### Why
Because we love music and want kids af all ages to learn musical notation.

### Sheets
The sheets come in animal, normal and color yourself versions. You can [create your own](https://github.com/larsenwork/animalnoteheads/tree/Lilypond) and/or browse the library on [animalnoteheads.com/sheets](/sheets)

### Piano
Use the free [Pianimo](https://itunes.apple.com/US/app/id995991116?mt=8) iOS app or get the the 0% commision 2$ [vinyl sticker set](http://www.redbubble.com/people/animalnoteheads/shop/) and put them on your piano/keyboard like the danish ones shown [here](assets/img/stickers.jpg).

### Affilliates
I'm interested in a company/organisation/foundation that would support the project in turn for e.g. "brought to you by ..." - I'd like to devote more time to the project and possibly make it completely free for everyone to use.-->
