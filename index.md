# Animal Note Heads

Makes note learning easy and fun

#### Sketch

![mockup](assets/img/AnimalNoteHeadsMockup.png)

#### PDF

The piano keys pdf template (to print out and put above the keys)
[A4](assets/pdf/AnimalNoteHeads-keys-en-A4.pdf) - [US Letter](assets/pdf/AnimalNoteHeads-keys-en-Letter.pdf)

#### Project

The ambition is to create a free database of easy to play childrens songs in many languages with the help of the online community.

#### Contribute

See the roadmap below and head over [GitHub](https://github.com/andreaslarsen/animalnoteheads) with your skills and ideas. 

#### Roadmap

1. Design the Note Heads done
2. Design the font - WIP with the help of [Abraham Lee](http://fonts.openlilylib.org)  
3. License - see below  
4. Lilypond template - technical, any [lilypond](http://www.lilypond.org) experts out there?
  * The concept will be to create multiple fonts for the different layers. 1 for black and 2 for the colors. And then utilise lilyponds ability to [color](http://lsr.di.unimi.it/LSR/Item?id=572) and change note heads based on pitch or maybe the [smiley function](http://lsr.di.unimi.it/LSR/Item?id=904)? 
5. Language support - currently en, dk - would like to add fr+es  
6. Website update - to browse all the sheets

#### License
