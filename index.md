### Concept

Alphabetical substitution of note heads with cute and colorful animals so it's easy and fun to learn musical notation.  
We will launch great things soon: an iOS piano app, sheet music library, tools to create your own sheet music and much more. It will all be free and most of it even for commercial use.  
I'll also be adding more physical products (posters, more stickers...other ideas?) that you can buy where I'll get a dollar or two from where I'm selling them.

### Printable Piano Guides

PDF in [color](assets/pdf/AnimalNoteHeads-keys-en-A4.pdf){:target="_blank"} or with [black outlines](assets/pdf/AnimalNoteHeads-keys-en-bw-A4.pdf){:target="_blank"}. Can be put behind the keys. Measure the octave length on your piano and divide it by 165mm (6.5") to get the print scale; e.g. 99/165 = 60%

### Vinyl Stickers

[14 vinyl stickers](http://www.redbubble.com/people/animalnoteheads/works/14838228-animalnoteheads-stickers?grid_pos=1&p=sticker){:target="_blank"} for 4$. Put them directly on the keys or anywhere you fancy.

### Sheets

They'll look something like this:

### Affilliates
I'm interested in a company/organisation that would support the project in turn for e.g. "brought to you by ..." - I'd like to devote more time to the project and possibly make it completely free for everyone to use.
