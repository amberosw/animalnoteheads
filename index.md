### Concept
Every note head is substituted and you can put a guide/stickers on your piano so that A equals alligator, Re es igual ratón, C er lig med chimpanze, Fa égale fourmi, Σολ ισούται με φίδι, etc...  

### Sheet music
An open source sheet music library and tools to create your own sheet music will be up very, very soon.

### Piano
Use the free Pianimo iOS app or buy the 4$ stickers.

<!--
### Affilliates
I'm interested in a company/organisation/foundation that would support the project in turn for e.g. "brought to you by ..." - I'd like to devote more time to the project and possibly make it completely free for everyone to use.-->
